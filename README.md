# Backgammon Bot Engine

A game engine coded in Rust that allows a computer to play the ancient game of backgammon against a player.

## History (From Wikipedia)
Backgammon is a two-player game dating back at least 500 years to Ireland. In Backgammon, each player has 15 pieces known traditionally as men (short for "tablemen"). These pieces move along 24 "points" according to the roll of two dice. The objective of the game is to move the 15 pieces around the board and be first to bear off, i.e., remove them from the board. The achievement of this while the opponent is still a long way behind results in a triple win known as a backgammon, hence the name of the game.

Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck from rolling of the dice. While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over a series of many games. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their pieces and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent.

## Why I wanted to make a Backgammon Engine
For many CS students, a very common project for learning algorithms is to code a chess bot engine. However, I grew up playing backgammon with my father, and wanted to create an engine for a game I am much more familiar with. Additionally, I chose the programming language Rust as while I have plenty of experience with C and C++ I have never used Rust before and was intrigued by some of its features such as the need to declare a variable as being mutable, it's memory safety, etc.
